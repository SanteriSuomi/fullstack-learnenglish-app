	const refreshWordPairs = () => {
		const url = `http://${process.env.REACT_APP_api_host}/wordpairs?username=${process.env.REACT_APP_api_user}&password=${process.env.REACT_APP_api_password}`;
		fetch(url, { method: "GET" })
			.then(async (response) => {
				if (response.ok) {
					return response.json();
				} else {
					let responseJson = await response.json();
					throw new Error(responseJson.msg);
				}
			})
			.then((data) => {
				setWordPairs(data.msg);
				return data;
			})
			.catch((err) => {
				console.log(err);
			});
	};
